# Build 2025 Lab 305
## Build Multi-platform Hybrid Apps with Blazor & .NET MAUI

In this lab, you'll build a hybrid mobile and desktop application using the [.NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid and Web](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/hybrid/tutorials/maui-blazor-web-app?view=aspnetcore-9.0#net-maui-blazor-hybrid-and-web-app-solution-template) template. This template combines a Blazor Web App and a .NET MAUI app, sharing UI components through a Razor Class Library (RCL). By the end of this 75-minute workshop, you'll have a functional app that displays data, navigates between pages, and uses platform-specific features.
