In this lab, you'll build a hybrid mobile, desktop and web application using the [.NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid and Web](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/hybrid/tutorials/maui-blazor-web-app?view=aspnetcore-9.0#net-maui-blazor-hybrid-and-web-app-solution-template) template. This template combines a Blazor Web app and a .NET MAUI app, sharing UI components through a Razor Class Library (RCL) that can be deployed to Android, iOS, macOS, Windows and the web. By the end of this 75-minute workshop, you'll have a functional app that displays data, navigates between pages, and uses platform-specific features.

At the end of this lab, you will build an app that looks like this across Android, iOS, macOS, Windows and web platforms.
